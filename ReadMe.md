# Webpage to Do Math for Bridget

## 1 - Time Calculation
 
This project contains a small web page that converts total minutes into hours + minutes.

What's new:
- Beautiful responsive styling (css/style.css)
- Refactored semantic HTML (`index.html`) with a friendly layout
- Small UI script with micro-interactions (`js/ui.js`)

How to preview locally:
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file), or
2. Serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended) — for example, with Python (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000; # then open http://localhost:8000
```

Enjoy — try typing 145 (or any minutes) and click Calculate.
